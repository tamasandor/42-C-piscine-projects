In this repository you can find all my Piscine code and a little extra that I tried and figured out how to solve.  

## I did my Piscine in [42 Wolfsburg](https://42wolfsburg.de/)  
  
After I finished my Piscine I recoded all the exercise that I did during the Piscine. 
Because of this I was able to fully understand the concept of strings and pointers in C, which I weren't able to do during my Piscine.

I installed Arch Linux and got comfortable using it as my everyday operating system.
